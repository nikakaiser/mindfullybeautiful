	<h3> about catherine </h3>
			<p>I believe your salon experience is about more than just your exterior beauty
service, it's about feeling your best inside and out. I take my time to listen
to each client, from your consultation to styling, to ensure you walk out of
the salon looking your best and feeling confident in your own natural
beauty.</p>
<p>I specialize in creative/special effects color - if you've always wanted to add
a little 'flare' to your look - to have purple hair or even just touches of color -
come in for a free consultation. I also offer balayagè highlights and ombrè,
hair straightening treatments and hair and lash extensions.</p>
<p>I keep up on the latest trends in beauty, fashion, hair and lash design. To
stay current and give my clients the best service possible I seek out opportunities for advanced education in my field. In the past year I attended the
American Board of Certified Hair Colorist Summit and took courses in color
correction and creative hair color; studied advanced precision hair cutting
at the Vidal Sassoon Academy; received certification with Brazilian
Blow-out and learned advanced Russian Volume lash extension techniques
with master lash artist, Nadia Afanaseva.</p>
<p>I use the healthiest professional hair products on the market that are also
free of many known toxins. Many of my products are organic, vegan, ammonia-free, formaldehyde-free, PPD-free, paraben-free, gluten-free & free
of other known allergens and irritants. This includes hair color & formaldehyde-free hair straightening treatments. If you have Celiac's disease,
eczema & gluten sensitivities or other allergies - I maybe be able to help.</p>
<p>I am also a certified lash extension technician with an artistic eye who will
create the perfect lash look customized to your eye shape and lifestyle. I
use silk & mink lashes and have been trained and certified in several different techniques and can create a natural look, 'cat-eyes', 3D volume and
more. Celebrities have been getting lash extensions for years - now this
celebrity secret is a luxury service that you can afford!</p>
<p>Come in, relax and let me take care of you and send you back out into the
world renewed and refreshed! Thank you for visiting this site. I look forward to meeting you soon.</p>
